# Learning

These are the Exercises I've been doing.

Currently learning Python from 'Introduction to Programming in Python>: An Interdisciplinary Approach', from Kevin Wayne, Robert Sedgewick and Robert Dondero.

I plan to make all the exercises in the book. The ones before 1.4.17 are lost, but should be here in the future for completion.

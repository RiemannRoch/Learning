# Learning

These are the Exercises I've been doing.

Currently learning Java from 'Computer Science, An interdisciplinary approach', by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

 Python from 'Introduction to Programming in Python>: An Interdisciplinary Approach', by Kevin Wayne, Robert Sedgewick and Robert Dondero.

I plan to make all the exercises in these books. The python ones before 1.4.17 are lost, but should be here in the future for completion. I started Java from section 1.5.
